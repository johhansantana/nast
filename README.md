# NextJS with TypeScript, Apollo and Redux 
This boilerplate has everything you need to start your app with typescript/next/apollo/redux.

Happy coding :)

## How to use
If you don't have [next-init](https://github.com/ragingwind/next-init) install it with:
```
npm install --global next-init
```

```
next-init johhansantana/nextjs-typescript-apollo ./typescriptAndApollo
```
  
```
npm install  # to install dependencies
```
```
npm run dev  # to compile TypeScript files and to run next.js  
```  

Output JS files are aside the related TypeScript ones.
